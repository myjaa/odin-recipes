        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Okay team, full stop. I have entirely depleted my creative writing capacity. I don't know how to make
            a key lime pie sound tasty. It's not my strong suit. Do you really need convincing here? How do I even
            describe this? I mean, do you really not know what Key Lime Pie is? That stuff is SO GOOD. Like, wow.
            Key Lime Pie is easily in my top 10 things ever. Not just foods. Things. That's how much this smacks.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>5 egg yolks, beaten (ðŸ˜³)</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup key lime juice</li>
            <li>1 (9 inch)(ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³) prepared graham cracker dust</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <p>Okay team, the website I'm shamelessly stealing this recipe off of has embedded images for each direction. This is unprecendented.
            I could embed the images on this site as well, but like, wow, that is just, so much effort. I mean, it's AWESOME from an.. 
            understandability...? standpoint. But wow, that is just, like, so much typing, man...</p>
