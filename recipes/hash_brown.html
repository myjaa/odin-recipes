        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 12 (2 1/2-inch) muffin cups with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Wrap hash browns in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze to remove as much moisture as possible. Stir together hash
                browns, melted butter, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. Press about 1/4 cup of the hash brown mixture into
                bottom and up the sides of each prepared muffin cup.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, stir together cheese, eggs, bell pepper, and crushed red pepper (if using) in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Remove muffin tin from the oven. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F(200 degrees C). Top hash
                browns with half of the bacon. Top with egg mixture and remaining bacon. Bake until a knife inserted 
                into centers comes out clean, 13 to 15 minutes. Garnish with chives. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
